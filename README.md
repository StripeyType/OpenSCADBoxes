# OpenSCADBoxes
Lasercuttable Flexboxes designed in OpenSCAD
This repository contains a number of OpenSCAD scripts for parametrically generating boxes using the living hinges. The scripts are capable of modelling the boxes as flat pieces or assembled items and then able to export them as 2 dimensional drawings suitable for laser cutting.
